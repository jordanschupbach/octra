Octra is a C project that has bindings for a variety of languages, including
Python, R, and JavaScript. It is merely meant to be used as a kickstart
template for similar projects that need to provide bindings to multiple
languages. As such, it is permissively licensed under the Unlicense.

It uses CMake as the build system, and Just as a task runner. The project
maintains a nix flake for easy development and testing.
